git clone <repository-url>
cd my-react-app

```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Chatbox Component

The `Chatbox` component is implemented in `src/components/Chatbox.jsx`. It contains the UI for the chatbox, including:

- A button to open and close the chatbox.
- An area to display messages exchanged between the user and the chatbot.
- An input field for the user to type their messages.

### Integrating Your Chatbot

To integrate your chatbot logic, replace the comment in the `handleSend` function within `Chatbox.jsx` with your chatbot function call. For example:

```javascript
const response = await yourChatbotFunction(input);
```

Make sure to update the messages state with the response from your chatbot:

```javascript
setMessages([...messages, { text: input, sender: "user" }, { text: response, sender: "bot" }]);
```
